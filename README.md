# SolarPHP
 
SolarPHP collects solar data from the [HamQSL](http://www.hamqsl.com/solarxml.php) Solar Data site, and produces a visual widget.  Unlike the other widgets on the site, it uses text rather than image renderings, which makes it more lightweight.

## Usage
The easiest way to use the app is to embed the following iframe in your page:

```
  <iframe src="http://allderek.com/AdvWidget.php" width="300px"></iframe>
```
